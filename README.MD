# SWOLEBOT.GO

SWOLEBOT IS NOW WRITTEN IN GOLANG, THE FAST, SCALABLE, AND CONCURRENT LANGUAGE. BECAUSE OF THIS IT IS NOW FASTER, MORE SCALABLE, AND MORE CONCURRENT THAN ITS PREVIOUS JAVASCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION (EVEN THOUGH THAT IMPLEMENTATION WAS ALSO VERY FAST, SCALABLE, AND CONCURRENT COMPARED TO OTHER LANGUAGES THAT ARE NOT AS FAST, SCALABLE, AND CONCURRENT).

## TODO

* MULTIPLE WORKOUTS
* ???

## RUNNING

TO RUN THIS (NOT LIKE THE EXCERSICE RUNNING) YOU WILL NEED [GOLANG](http://golang.org/) (THE FAST, SCALABLE, AND CONCURRENT LANGUAGE).

YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO SET AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:

```sh
export SLACK_TOKEN=...
```
